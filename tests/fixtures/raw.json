Not only that, but we need to be able to rely on HttpClient while also keeping our code testable. I'll try to keep this as a \"short\" stream, and I'll touch on a few topics you may not be doing to achieve maximum flexibility with your HttpClient requirements.\n\nInterested in speaking or recording a talk for us to stream?

Go to https://www.kcdc.info/ for tickets and information.\n\nTopic:\n\\# Data Patterns for Successful Applications\n\nIt has been said that data is the new currency. The more your company relies on data the more you need to understand data patterns for handling how data comes into your systems, managed, stored, and represented. We are no longer in the world of \"just use a single\" database. We now need to choose the right data management and storage tools based on business objectives. This means understanding more than a relational database like SQL Server or Oracle. It means understanding what database option is best based on business processes. It also means understanding patterns that can be applied to data that allow for better data analysis, and cost effective storage.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss data patterns that can be applied at the application level as well as database. Are you processing and storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or perhaps credit card information (PCI-DSS)? You'll also see data protection options for data in-transit and at rest. We'll also discuss patterns for keeping a history of changes with Event Sourcing. You'll also learn about the CQRS pattern used to keep the demand for retrieving data from impacting the ability of receiving new data.\n\nBio:\nSean is a Microsoft MVP, president of Tulsa .NET User Group since 2009, and a Sr. Cloud Architect with ArchitectNow.

              "description": "This month, we'll be doing Lightning Talks ⚡️ in-person at Clevyr! Join us for a free Tuesday lunch while listening to some awesome local speakers talk about all things dev-related. We'll share our current lineup soon, and we are actively looking to fill a couple more slots as well (more on that below).\n\nBut wait! What are lightning talks? We're glad you asked: A lightning talk is a short 5-10 minute talk over anything that you find interesting, and typically we have 3-4 talks total during a Lightning Talk meetup. Talk topics can range over a personal project, a new technology, or just something that makes you think \"hey, I bet other people might like to know about this thing.\" It's a great way for you as an attendee (and speaker!) to learn about a lot of new things that you didn't know about before.\n\nIf you're interested in speaking, reach out to @thecodeboss (Aaron Krauss) or @Vincent (Stephen Vincent) in the Techlahoma Slack if you would like to speak.\n\nLightning talks are a great opportunity for first-time speakers to step out of your comfort zone and get up on the stage. If that's you, then we'd love to have you, and we'll work with you every step of the way to make sure you feel comfortable and ready to give your talk. To sign up for this event (a future talk too), hit up @thecodeboss (Aaron Krauss) or @Vincent (Stephen Vincent) in the Techlahoma Slack.\n\nThis meetup is in-person at Clevyr (where the food, drinks, and parking are always free), and will also be streamed live on Techlahoma's Twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/techlahoma.",
