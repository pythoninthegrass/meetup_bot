    "description": "This month, we'll be doing Lightning Talks \u26a1\ufe0f at Clevyr!\n\nA lightning talk is a short \\~5-10 minute talk over anything that you find interesting! Talk topics can range over a personal project, a new technology, or just something that makes you think \"hey, I bet other people might like to know about this thing.\" It's a great way for you as an attendee (and speaker!) to learn about a lot of new things that you didn't know about before.\n\n* Tabby Douglass\n* Michelle Tabor\n* Snigdha Alathur\n* Valerie Blackburn\n\nLight refreshments and lunch will be provided!",
